Main components are:
1) Arduino Mego 2560
2) ESP8266 wifi
3) IFTTT connection via Requests with GET
4) Smasung Smart Things Outlet controller

It utilizes code found in the uctronics repo, from lesson 18 which displays the info on the screen.

To use this code you will need to creat an IFTTT recipe.  check out the code for more inormation about this.
